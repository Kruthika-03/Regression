# Regression
Calculation of the errors in regression with and without regularization:

## Regression
Regression is a type of predictive analysis. The idea of regression is to observe whether a set predictor does a good job in predicting the dependent variable and to observe which variable in particular is significant in prediction of the outcome. It is used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable with one or more independent variable. The easiest for of regression is the linear regression. It is given by the formula y=mx+c, wherein x is independent, m is the intercept, c is the constant and y is the dependent variable.

## Application of Regression
Primary uses for regression are seen in business in the forecasting and optimization. It can be used to help managers predict the demand for their products and fine tune the delivery and the manufacturing process.
Since Regression is used for prediction problems. Here I have considered a prediction problem to show the application of PCA.

## Dataset Description:
I have considered the dataset from the Scikit-learn library. The scikit-learn Boston dataset is used in regression and a famous dataset from 1970â€™s. It consists of 506 instances and 14 attributes. Here linear regression is performed to find the relationship between a target and one or more predictors. Where the target is the dependent variable and the predictors are the independent variables.
